# Gap Register

**Status:** `specified`; update with every architecture or milestone change.

| ID | Priority | Gap | Impact | Required disposition |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| GAP-001 | P0 | Shipped/local/provisional/design claims conflict across docs. | False production expectations. | Maintain status ledger and evidence links. |
| GAP-002 | P0 | Authority matrix for auth, policy, budget, Redis, evidence is incomplete. | Incorrect fail-open behavior. | Accept plane and authority ADR. |
| GAP-003 | P0 | No complete route/proto/event/MCP contract registry. | Unreviewable compatibility drift. | Build registry and CI checks. |
| GAP-004 | P0 | 20/40/45/50/100 ms claims conflict and are unmeasured. | Impossible SLO ownership. | Ratify one budget and publish benchmarks. |
| GAP-005 | P0 | Tenant isolation/deletion/evidence coverage is not end-to-end proven. | Catastrophic confidentiality/integrity risk. | Cross-tenant, deletion, restore, and outbox gates. |
| GAP-006 | P0 | Atomic reservation/idempotency/reconciliation is not accepted. | Billing/cost integrity risk. | Define durable ledger and failure semantics. |
| GAP-007 | P1 | Generic memory record lacks typed lifecycle/provenance/checkpoints. | Poisoning, stale context, irreproducible behavior. | Accept typed memory/context contract. |
| GAP-008 | P1 | Provider alias/capability/streaming/usage semantics are fragmented. | Silent semantic loss and unsafe fallback. | Capability manifest and conformance matrix. |
| GAP-009 | P1 | MCP/operator boundaries and audit status are mixed. | Privilege and support confusion. | Read-only-first contract and operator API boundary. |
| GAP-010 | P1 | DecisionService/model registry/calibration/benchmark do not exist. | Model overreach and unmeasured latency. | Keep design-intent; gate at G10. |
| GAP-011 | P1 | Backup/restore/migration/incident/operator evidence is incomplete. | Unrecoverable production state. | Profile-specific recovery drills. |
| GAP-012 | P2 | Graph/A2A/marketplace/sandbox/broad provider expansion is premature. | Scope and dependency explosion. | Keep deferred until core gates pass. |

Every gap needs an owner, source references, decision date, dependency, evidence artifact, and disposition. Closing prose is not closing evidence.
